# Challenge-4-Anton-Osland

## Description

I built this website to create a place for people to submit song recommendations. At the moment it does not connect to the internet so you cannot see other users submissions, but the framework is there for future development. This project was challenging to start off, and pushed me to use all my JavaScript knowledge I've learned so far. I am starting to see how powerful functions and loops are, and in this project I utilized my own functions for the first time.

## Installation

[Live Website!](https://anton-oz.github.io/Challenge-4/blog.html)

## Usage

To use the site fill out the blog post form and click submit. Once submitted you will be redirected to blog.html and you will see your post displayed. Click submit a song in the navbar to submit another post, or click clear to clear all posts.
